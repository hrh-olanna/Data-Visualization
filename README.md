Netflix Data Visualization

•	Setup: Use Python 3 with pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib installed. For R, ensure ggplot2 is available.
•	Running Python Code: Execute the Python script step-by-step or in sections. First run the unzip/rename code to create Netflix_shows_movies.csv. Then run data cleaning, exploration, and visualization sections. The script will output console prints (from info() and describe()) and save two PNG charts: genre_counts.png and rating_distribution.png.
•	Running R Code: In R, set the working directory to where Netflix_shows_movies.csv is located. Source the R code to produce the rating distribution chart. The chart will pop up in the R graphics device.
•	Interpreting Results: After running the code, inspect the printed data summaries in Python to understand data composition. Review the saved charts: genre_counts.png shows the most common genres (bars ordered by frequency), and rating_distribution.png shows how many titles fall into each rating category. The R plot reproduces the rating distribution for verification.
